# Investigating_TMDb_Movie_Dataset
Investigation of data associated with collection of movies from TMDb.
This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The TMDb Movie dataset has been selected for investigation using NumPy and Pandas. The dataset is a collection of information on around 10000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
- Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
- The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
